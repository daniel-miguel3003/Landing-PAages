                Nope, no funny business. Allit takes to start your account is 
                your email address and a few other pieces of information. We 
                don't even ask for your credit card.

                The Free Plan has room for five videos and comes with 200 GB
                of <u>bandwidth</u> per month. After you've uploaded 5 videos, you
                can upgrade to a <u>paid plan</u> for more sopace. If your videos
                exceed 200 GB of bandwidth in a given month, they'll stop
                playing until your bandwidth resets at the start of the next
                month. Don't worry thoughm we've found 200 GB of monthly 
                bandwidth is enough for 95% of all users.
